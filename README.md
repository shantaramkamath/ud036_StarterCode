# Movie-Trailer-Website
This project will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers.
The Movie Class in the **media.py** module creates a data structure to store my favorite movies, including movie title, movie poster URL and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
The Python module called **fresh_tomatoes.py** has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of my favorite movies.

## WHAT'S INCLUDED
